<br/>

ðŸ›  I used Xcode 11.7 to build this project.<br/>
ðŸ§± This project has been build following the __MVVM-C__ architecture (Model View ViewModel and Coordinators).<br/>
ðŸ“¦ I used some tools of mine that are stored on a private repository. I could show you later if needed, mostly the coordinators classes and some views components. I had to change almost all of them since it included some RxSwift/RxCocoa functions.<br/>
ðŸŒš The app is darkmode compatible on iOS 13 and above and keeps the classic light mode on below versions.<br/>
ðŸŒ„ Icons are stored in the project as PDF files since I can't use the SVG option.<br/>
ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·+ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ This project is using a few translation keys and handle english and french languages.<br/>
